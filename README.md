# Dude-wheres-my-charger
The application was created for an electric car owner who is looking for charging stations within a specific location area (urban).The application will utilize free API's for an open charge map and an  forward geocoding to assist with location finders. The application will be using Local Storage for remembering prior entered locations.


USER STORY:
As an electric car owner
I want to find charge outlets for my vehicle 
By location with a specific radius 
So I can be flexible with my travel plans within a city location/limits.


When I search the location
Then a selection of charge stations are populated on the screen

When I click on the address 
Then it takes me to google maps.

When I type in a city name,
Then the application will remember that location, and will be able to be retrieved after the page refreshes.


INFOMATION: 
This application will utilize: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Tailwind.
The third party API website links used :
https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api

*If there is a time, free vs. membership with charging station locations.

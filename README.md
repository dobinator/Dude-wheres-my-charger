# Dude-wheres-my-charger
The application was created for an electric car owner who is looking for charging stations within a specific location area (urban).The application will utilize free API's for an open charge map and an  forward geocoding to assist with location finders. The application will be using Local Storage for remembering prior entered locations.

Application is deployed at this [link](https://dobinator.github.io/Dude-wheres-my-charger/)

## USER STORY:
As an electric car owner  
I want to find charge outlets for my vehicle   
By location with a specific radius  
So I can be flexible with my travel plans within a city location/limits.  


When I search the location  
Then a selection of charge stations are populated on the screen

When I click on the address   
Then it takes me to google maps.

When I type in a city name,  
Then the application will remember that location, and will be able to be retrieved after the page refreshes.


## INFOMATION: 
This application will utilize: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Tailwind.  
This api uses 2 third part apis:  
[Open Charge Map](https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api)  
[Open Weather Map Api](https://openweathermap.org/api) (used to get lat and lon coordinants)

(initial plan was to use [position stack](https://positionstack.com/) to get the coordinants but the free tier does not support https)
